website-archive
===============

The hope that my hosting provider will be around forever is something I can't count on, nor can I count on the CMS forever being maintained. Instead, I am trying to take a snapshot of the site, in situ, each month and write the files to something more stable. After that, I am pushing the data to GitHub for longer term storage. This has problems too, but as a git repository, it is much more portable for the future while still containing all the versioning and historical data.

So this is the first test, back-up and archiving (optional.is)

I don't expect anyone to use or fork these pages, they are all the public pages available on the site. This repo is more used as a back-up incase something horrible should happen.

The backup.sh file are the commands for you to do the same. Feel free to copy that and start your own back-ups.
